                        <strong>Log Files:</strong> The application processes poker log files that you explicitly select and upload from your device. This data is processed locally on your device to calculate statistics and is also sent to Google's Gemini API for the "AI Poker Coach" and "Exploits" features. The log file content is not stored or collected by the application developer.

                        <strong>Gemini API Key:</strong> The application allows you to enter your own Google Gemini API Key. This key is saved only in your device's local storage (local cache) for your convenience and is never transmitted to, or stored by, the application developer. It is used solely to make calls to the Gemini API from your device.

                        <strong>No User Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, location, or contacts. The app does not have user accounts.
